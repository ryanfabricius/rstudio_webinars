## Rstudio Webinars

This repository will be used to document my journey through the webinars posted on Rstudio. The documents pushed to this repo will be examples I have worked through. Additionally, I will create a reference of R packages that I thought I needed to document, for use in later projects.

If you are interested in the books I have been reading, you can view the documentation of my journey throughout each book at my "books" repo.
